# Getting Started

1. run `npm run db:reset` to reset the db
2. run `npm run db:generate` to set things up if the server doesn't start
3. run `npm start`
4. Enjoy

# This Repository

This is a skeleton repository that you can use to complete the take home challenge. It provides some
basic structure and tooling to get you started. You are welcome to use a different setup if you
prefer.

The `api` is a basic Express application and uses Prisma for data access with a SQLite database.

The `client` is a basic Vite + React application.

All dependencies are installed in the root of the project for simplicity. You can run both projects
together with

```
$> npm run start
```

or individually with

```
$> npm run start:api
$> npm run start:client
```

The API and client will both automatically reload on file changes to help speed up development.

# Hugo Full Stack Challenge

## Scenario

At Hugo, customers often start the insurance application process on an external third party site,
where that third party site then sends the collected information to our service so that the user can
continue their application process and receive a price quote.

## Task

### Backend

Create a web API that exposes four endpoints:

1. `POST` route that starts a new insurance application and initializes it with the provided data -
   This route should return a “resume” route that points to the frontend URL to load the created
   application
2. `GET` route that can retrieve the current insurance application
3. `PUT` route that will update the insurance application with provided data
    - This should accept partial fields from the quote application. Each submitted field needs to
      pass validation in order to be updated.
    - The quote application as a whole may still be incomplete and should not cause this route to
      fail.
4. `POST` route that validates the entire application and returns a price
    - You do not actually need to do any calculation here, returning a random number value would be
      sufficient

### Frontend

Create a React frontend that can display the current application state, and can allow information to
be added or edited. The frontend should do basic validation, and when all the required information
is completely filled out, allow the application to be submitted for completion, and display either
an error message if the application is not complete or the quoted price to purchase insurance.

## Data Specifications

The data that an insurance application needs consists of the following:

-   First and Last name
-   Date of Birth (validate that input is a date and at least 16 years old)
-   Address
    -   Street
    -   City
    -   State
    -   ZipCode (validate numeric, but don’t worry about validating if zip code exists)
-   Vehicle(s) (must have 1 vehicle, cannot have more than 3 total)
    -   VIN
    -   Year (validate numeric and valid year between 1985 and current year + 1)
    -   Make and Model

## Guidelines

-   Provide setup instructions for the frontend and backend projects
-   The submission should be self-contained and ran locally. Please avoid connecting to external
    services or databases.
    -   Instructions/scripts to provision local databases should be included with the submission.
-   Feel free to use any starter kit/bootstrapping tools you feel comfortable with to create the
    initial project (i.e. create-react-app, vite, etc for the front end) or use this one.
-   Don’t focus too much on the styling/UX of the frontend. Focus more on component
    organization/structure
-   Backend can use any flavor of SQL for data storage.
    -   Ensure that the frontend can resume the same application if the page is closed and reopened

## Stretch Goals

Implement the following if you have time or can plan to include within the time frame:

-   Use TypeScript with appropriate type definitions
-   Allow adding additional people to the insurance application:
    -   First and Last name
    -   Date of Birth
    -   Relationship (Spouse, Sibling, Parent, Friend, Other)
